### Use-case
Want to analyze the cases where the http manager is in shutdown and blocked on
the Socket Thread.  So we want to:
- Paste in the signatures for the http manager, no need to include the misses.
- Have it filter to the "Socket Thread" across all of those.
- Aggregate those into a flame graph.

## Searchfox File Exploration
A whole-page mode with a top-bar or side-bar (depending on aspect ratio) that
displays:
- A straight-up current breadcrumb traversal.  This updates as the back button
  (or equivalent) is used, popping things off the traversal.  This also has
  finite depth, so eventually this get removed.
- A graph of all edges followed during the current exploration.

Exploration / navigation takes the form of:
- Whole-page search results using the react 'raw' widgets.
- Context menu is of course the fancy one, but with "eyeball replacement"
  traversal "navigating" the page.
  - Things that spawn other sheets should (eventually) go to a linked window via
    window.open.  This does have session implications, as the other window
    either wants to be a full session, or we want to treat the full-page view as
    a "track" that's mutually exclusive with the default set.
    - A-ha!  Yeah.  We have one track for full-page views.  Each sheet is a page
      on its own.
- Traversals add an edge in the graph.  Some UI is added to delete boring edges
  or nodes (which really means clearing out all its edges).
